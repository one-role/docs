# Ansible documentation and setup

This is the Ansible Setup configuration, the setup for the complete
Ansible development tree.

This documentation is auto-generated with the aid of
[MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and some small scripting.

All used Ansible roles (should) contain a `README.md` file with the
documentation of that role.

A small script (`bin/refresh`) gathers all README's and places all
documentation in the MKDocs tree.
