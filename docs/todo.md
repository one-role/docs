# TODO list

## Tasks & issues

* [x] Mirror local repositories
* [x] Find out why Ara, MySQL and WSGI do **not** play nicely together!\
      For now: Ara drops the data in an SQLite database\
      Gave it a go, but there are still issues. Dropped a ping in IRC.\
      **2018-12-04**: Nice _Sinterklaas_ present: When I switch ARA to the
      MySQL database and restart ARA and Apache, everything works as
      expected. So this will be a keeper, for now.
